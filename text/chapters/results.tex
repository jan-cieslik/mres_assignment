\subsection{Identification of a possible novel prognostic marker}
In a multivariate Cox analysis in 1218 breast cancer patients I could identify 2078 significantly (q-value < 0.05) associated genes with the overall survival.
SPIB was associated with a beneficial harzard ratio (HR: 0.91; q-value: 2.82\%).
