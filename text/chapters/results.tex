\subsection{Identification of a possible novel prognostic marker}

In a multivariate Cox analysis in 1218 breast cancer patients I could identify 2078 significantly (q-value < 0.05) associated genes (mRNA expression) with the overall survival.
SPIB was associated with a beneficial harzard ratio (HR: 0.91; q-value: 2.82\%; Fig.~\ref{km_plot}).
Further, patients overexpressing SPIB have an overall median survival of 130 months, while low expressing patients survive for a median of 112 months (logrank p: 0.01; Fig.~\ref{km_plot}).

\subsection{Methlyation and mRNA Expression (cg19387862)}

Next, I focussed on the regulation of SPIB through methylation.
Through spearman correlation, a significant negative association between methylation of SPIB and mRNA expression levels could be shown ($cor = 0.55; p= 4.11 \cdot 10^{-44}$; Fig.~\ref{methylation}).

\subsection{Copy Number Alteration and mRNA Expression}

Another way mRNA expression could be modified is through copy number alteration.
As seen in Fig.~\ref{cnv}, no significant difference between the copy number levels could be shown (one-way independent ANOVA; $p > 0.05$).
