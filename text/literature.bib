  abstract  = {Anoikis (detachment-induced cell death) is a specific type of programmed cell death which occurs in response to the loss of the correct extracellular matrix connections. Anoikis resistance is an important mechanism in cancer invasiveness and metastatic behavior. Autophagy, on the other hand, involves the degradation of damaged organelles and the recycling of misfolded proteins and intracellular components. However, the intersection of these two cellular responses in lung cancer cells has not been extensively studied. Here, we identified that upon matrix deprivation, the lymphocyte lineage-specific Ets transcription factor SPIB was activated and directly enhanced SNAP47 transcription in certain lung cancer cells. Loss of attachment-induced autophagy significantly increased anoikis resistance by SPIB activation. Consistent with this function, SPIB depletion by short hairpin RNA abrogated SNAP47 transcriptional activation upon matrix deprivation. Therefore, these data delineate an important role of SPIB in autophagy-mediated anoikis resistance in lung cancer cells. Accordingly, these findings suggest that manipulating SPIB-regulated pathways in vivo and evaluating the impact of anoikis resistance warrant further investigation. Database RNA sequencing and ChIP sequencing data are available in Gene Expression Omnibus database under the accession numbers GSE106592 and GSE125561, respectively.},

  abstract = {Tumor immune escape plays a critical role in malignant tumor progression and leads to the failure of anticancer immunotherapy. Spi-B, a lymphocyte lineage-specific Ets transcription factor, participates in mesenchymal invasion and favors metastasis in human lung cancer. However, the mechanism through which Spi-B regulates the tumor immune environment has not been elucidated. In this study, we demonstrated that Spi-B enhanced the infiltration of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment using subcutaneous mouse models and clinical samples of human lung cancer. Spi-B overexpression increased the expression of TAM polarization- and recruitment-related genes, including CCL4. Moreover, deleting CCL4 inhibited the ability of Spi-B promoting macrophage infiltration. These data suggest that Spi-B promotes the recruitment of TAMs to the tumor microenvironment via upregulating CCL4 expression, which contributes to the progression of lung cancer.},

  abstract = {Spi-B transcription factor (SPIB) is a member of the E-twenty-six (ETS) transcription factor family. Previous studies have shown that the expression of SPIB is downregulated in human colorectal cancer tissues. The purpose of our study was to explore the biological function and related mechanism of SPIB in colorectal cancer cells. Our study found that SPIB could inhibit the proliferation, migration and invasion of CRC cells; inhibit angiogenesis; and induce CRC cells cycle arrest in G2/M phase and promote the apoptosis of CRC cells. We also found that compared with the control group, the 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of oxaliplatin and 5-FU in the SPIB overexpression group were significantly reduced. Western blot results showed that the overexpression of SPIB upregulated cleaved-PARP(c-PARP), nuclear factor kB p65 (NFkB p65), phospho-NFkB p65 (p-NFkB P65), JNK1, and C-Jun protein expression levels compared with the control group. The silence of SPIB downregulated c-PARP, NF?B p65, p-NF?B p65, JNK1, and C-Jun protein expression levels. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that SPIB could activate the promoter of MAP4K1 and enhance the expression of MAP4K1. After silencing MAP4K1, the protein expression levels of c-PARP, NFkB P65, p-NFkB P65, JNK1, and C-Jun were downregulated. In summary, we found that SPIB is a tumor suppressor in colorectal cancer cells and that SPIB sensitizes colorectal cancer cells to oxaliplatin and 5-FU, SPIB exerts its anti-colorectal cancer effect by activating the NFkB and JNK signaling pathways through MAP4K1. The above findings may provide a reference for new molecular markers and therapeutic targets for CRC.},

  abstract = {Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) is the second most prevalent histologic subtype of invasive breast cancer. Here, we comprehensively profiled 817 breast tumors, including 127 ILC, 490 ductal (IDC), and 88 mixed IDC/ILC. Besides E-cadherin loss, the best known ILC genetic hallmark, we identified mutations targeting PTEN, TBX3, and FOXA1 as ILC enriched features. PTEN loss associated with increased AKT phosphorylation, which was highest in ILC among all breast cancer subtypes. Spatially clustered FOXA1 mutations correlated with increased FOXA1 expression and activity. Conversely, GATA3 mutations and high expression characterized luminal A IDC, suggesting differential modulation of ER activity in ILC and IDC. Proliferation and immune-related signatures determined three ILC transcriptional subtypes associated with survival differences. Mixed IDC/ILC cases were molecularly classified as ILC-like and IDC-like revealing no true hybrid features. This multidimensional molecular atlas sheds new light on the genetic bases of ILC and provides potential clinical options.},

  abstract  = {Objective:This present study aims to investigate the potential prognostic values of dynactin genes (DCTN) for predicting the overall survival (OS) in low-grade glioma (LGG) patients.Methods:The DCTN mRNA expression data were downloaded from The Cancer Genome Atlas database containing 518 patients with LGG. The Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses for DCTN genes were performed by using Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery platform, and their enrichment results were verified by using the Biological Networks Gene Ontology tool. Next, the correlations between DCTN genes and LGG were identified by Pearson correlation coefficient analysis. The OS was estimated by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The cBio Cancer Genomics Portal was used to analyze the mutations of DCTN genes and their effects on the prognosis of LGG. The correlation between the abundance of immune infiltration and tumor purity of DCTN genes were predicted by The Tumor Immune Estimation Resource.Results:Our research showed that the mRNA expression of DCTN4 in tumor tissues was much higher (P {\textless} 0.01) than that in normal tissues. Meanwhile, there was a certain correlation between the DCTN genes. Survival analysis showed that the high expression of DCTN1, DCTN3, DCTN4, DCTN6, and their co-expression were significantly correlated with favorable OS in LGG patients (P {\textless} 0.05). In DCTN2, a high mutation rate was observed. Further research showed that the genetic alteration in DCTN genes was related to a poor OS and progression-free survival of LGG patients. The expression of DCTN genes had a certain correlation with immune infiltrating cells.Conclusion:Our study showed that the high expressions of DCTN1, DCTN3, DCTN4, and DCTN6 were associated with a favorable OS of LGG patients, indicating that these DCTN genes are potential biomarkers for evaluating the prognosis of LGG patients.},

  abstract = {Background Colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) is ranked as the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in both women and men, and it is the most frequently occurring malignant tumor. Dynactin is a protein compound based on multiple subunits, including dynactin 1–6 (DCTN1–6), in most categories of cytoplasmic dynein performance in eukaryotes. Nevertheless, correlations between the DCTN family and the prognosis and diagnosis of COAD remain unidentified.  Methods Statistics for DCTN mRNA expression in patients with COAD were acquired from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Kaplan–Meier analyses and a Cox regression model were applied to determine overall survival, with computation of HRs and 95\% CIs. Several online data portals were used to assess the biological process, and pathway examination was performed using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to predict the biological functionality of DCTN genes.  Results We found that high expression of DCTN4 was linked with satisfactory results for overall survival (P=0.042, HR=0.650, 95\% CI 0.429–0.985). The expression of DCTN1, DATN2, and DCTN4 was closely correlated with the frequency of colon tumors (P{\textless}0.001, area under the curve [AUC]=0.8811, 95\% CI 0.8311–0.9312; P{\textless}0.001, AUC=0.870, 96\% CI 0.833–0.9071; and P=0.0051, AUC=0.6317, 95\% CI 0.5725–0.6908, respectively). In the enrichment examination, the level of gene expression was related to the cell cycle, cell apoptosis, and the cell metastasis pathway.  Conclusion The expression levels of DCTN1, DCTN2, and DCTN4 could allow differentiation between cancer-bearing tissues and paracancerous tissue. These genes can be applied as biomarkers to predict the prognosis and diagnosis of COAD.},

We have recently identified transcriptional activation of p27 by FOXA1. In this study, we analyzed the activities and expression pattern of FOXA1 in breast cancer. Forced expression of FOXA1 inhibited clonal growth of breast cancer cell lines, and FOXA1 levels inversely correlated with growth stimuli. In the estrogen receptor (ER)-positive MCF-7 cells, FOXA1 increased p27 promoter activity and inhibited the ER pathway activity. Analysis of FOXA1 expression in breast tissue arrays revealed significantly higher expression in pure ductal carcinomas in situ compared to invasive ductal carcinomas (IDC); and in IDC, high expression of FOXA1 was associated with favorable prognostic factors. Yet, FOXA1 expression was noted in a subset of the ER-negative tumors. Taken together, our findings suggest a growth inhibitory role for FOXA1, and identify it as a novel, potential prognostic factor in breast cancer. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},
